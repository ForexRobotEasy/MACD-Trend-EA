# MACD Trend EA

This code is an Expert Advisor (EA) for MetaTrader 5 (mql5) that uses the MACD indicator to generate trading signals. The EA opens buy trades when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, and sell trades when the MACD line crosses below the signal line.

## Functionality

The EA uses the `OnTick()` function to continuously monitor market movements and generate trading signals based on the MACD indicator. It calculates the MACD line, signal line, and histogram values using the `iMACD()` function. If the MACD line is above the signal line, a buy trade is opened with specified stop loss and take profit levels. If the MACD line is below the signal line, a sell trade is opened. Additionally, a trailing stop can be set if desired.

## Parameters

The EA allows customization through input parameters. The following parameters can be adjusted according to user preferences:

- `FastMA`: Fast moving average period for MACD calculation
- `SlowMA`: Slow moving average period for MACD calculation
- `SignalMA`: Signal line period for MACD calculation
- `StopLoss`: Stop loss level in points
- `TakeProfit`: Take profit level in points
- `TrailingStop`: Trailing stop level in points

## Custom Functions

The code includes a few custom functions to enhance functionality:

- `NormalizeDouble()`: A utility function to round a double value to a specified number of digits.

## Chart Properties and Trade Signals

The code includes placeholder functions `SetChartProperties()` and `DisplayTradeSignals()` for setting chart properties and displaying trade signals on the chart, respectively. These functions can be customized or removed based on user preferences.

## Error Handling

The code includes a placeholder function `ErrorHandling()` for error handling and logging. This function can be customized or expanded as needed.
